**Date:** January 26, 2026 | **Sample:** 11,622 voyages

---

## Key Findings

| Analysis | Finding | Implication |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **A1: Star Emergence** | r = 0.60 from voyage 1 | Talent identified immediately |
| **A3: Route Depletion** | N Pacific: -3.3%/decade | Fastest declining grounds |
| **A6: Vessel Types** | Ship > Schr by 2+ log pts | Capital matters |
| **A12: Survival** | 61% continue after v1 | High selection pressure |
| **A13: Production** | Elasticity = 1.78 | Increasing returns to scale |
| **A14: Matching** | r = -0.05 (α, γ) | Substitutes, not complements |

## Deep Dives

### A1: Star Emergence

- First voyage predicts later performance (r = 0.60)
- Predictability stable across voyages 1-5
- **Implication:** Agents identify talent early

### A2: Agent Networks

- 2,021 captains worked for 2+ agents (50%)
- 6,697 agent pairs share captains
- Network density suggests active labor market

### A3: Route Depletion

| Route | Trend/Decade |
|-------|--------------|
| N Pacific | -3.3% |
| Japan/Ochotsk | -3.3% |
| Patagonia | -3.2% |
| Pacific | -0.5% |

## Labor Market Structure

### A5: Port Markets

| Port | Voyages | Captains/Agent |
|------|---------|----------------|
| New Bedford | 4,175 | 5.2 |
| Nantucket | 1,321 | 3.0 |
| New London | 766 | 5.4 |
| Sag Harbor | 570 | 4.5 |

### A9: Agent Entry/Exit

- Peak entry: 1830s (336) and 1840s (287)
- Exit followed with 5-10 year lag
- Industry contraction visible from 1850s

---

## Career Dynamics

### A8: Exit Patterns

- Median career: **2 voyages**
- Last voyage production: **-0.25** log points
- Performance decline before exit

### A11: Career Trajectory

| Stage | Mean Production |
|-------|-----------------|
| Early | 6.72 |
| Mid | **6.84** (peak) |
| Late | 6.60 |

### A12: Survival Curve

| Voyage | Continue % |
|--------|------------|
| 1 | 61% |
| 2 | 66% |
| 3 | 67% |
| 4+ | ~67-73% |

## Economic Structure

### A13: Production Function

```
logQ = 1.78 × log(tonnage) + constant
```

- **Elasticity > 1:** Increasing returns to scale
- R² = 0.51 (tonnage alone)

### A14: Assortative Matching

| Era | Corr(α̂, γ̂) |
|-----|-------------|
| Pre-1870 | -0.050 |
| Post-1870 | -0.047 |

**Negative assortative matching:** High-skill captains match with lower-capability agents (substitutes).

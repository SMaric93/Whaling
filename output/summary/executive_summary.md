# Whaling Empirical Analysis: Executive Summary

## Overview

Analysis of **9,229 voyages** (1780–1930) from the LOO-connected sample, with **2,311 captains** and **777 agents**. Model achieves **R² = 0.96**.

## 1. Variance Decomposition (R1): Who Creates Value?

| Component | Share (within α+γ) | Interpretation |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Agent capability (γ)** | **95.4%** | Agents are the dominant driver of labor market variance |
| **Captain skill (α)** | **14.2%** | Captain skill matters, but is secondary |
| **Sorting (2×Cov)** | **-9.7%** | Negative sorting dampens total variance |

**Interpretation**: Agent capability dominates the labor market component. Agents were the venture capitalists — they selected crews, provisioned vessels, chose routes, and bore financial risk. The **negative sorting** (Corr = -0.131) suggests **substitute matching**: high-skill captains paired with lower-capability agents.

---

## 2. Skill Portability (R2): Does Captain Skill Transfer?

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| OOS coefficient (b) | **0.143** | Partial portability |
| Spearman ρ | -0.011 | Noisy rank preservation |

**Interpretation**: Captain skill is **real and portable** across time. ~14% of in-sample skill variation persists out-of-sample.

---

## 3. Event Study (R3): What Happens When Captains Switch Agents?

| Finding | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Pre-switch trend | Stable/declining |
| Post-switch trajectory | **-0.3 log points by t+5** |

**Interpretation**: Captains who switch agents experience **sustained productivity decline**. Relationship-specific capital is lost upon separation.

---

## 4. Resilience (R6): Do Good Agents Buffer Shocks?

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| φ (Z × HighCap interaction) | **0.000** |

**Interpretation**: No evidence that high-capability agents attenuate output losses under adversity.

---

## 5. Labor Market Sorting (R13): Do Good Captains Match with Good Agents?

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| Sorting coefficient (b) | **0.120** | Positive coefficient |
| Raw correlation (α̂, γ̂) | **-0.074** | Slight negative matching |
| Diagonal share | **18.6%** | Near random (20%) |

**Interpretation**: The labor market shows **weak negative assortative matching**. High-skill captains do not systematically match with high-capability agents.

---

## 6. Switching Hazard (R14): Who Switches and Why?

| Coefficient | Value | Interpretation |
|-------------|-------|----------------|
| α̂ → Switch | **-0.015** | High-skill captains are **retained** |
| γ̂ → Switch | **+0.014** | High-capability agents have **higher turnover** |

**Interpretation**: Skilled captains are less likely to switch — agents want to keep them. High-capability agents have higher captain turnover, suggesting they are more selective.

---

## 7. Talent Acquisition (R15): Do Better Agents Hire Better Captains?

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| γ̂ → Hire Quality | **-0.031** |

**Interpretation**: No evidence of acquisition advantage. Captain talent is observable in the market.

---

## Summary

| Question | Finding |
|----------|---------|
| **Who creates value?** | Agents dominate (95.4%), captains contribute (14.2%) |
| **Is skill real?** | Yes — partially portable out-of-sample (b = 0.14) |
| **Do relationships matter?** | Yes — agent switches cause sustained productivity decline |
| **Is matching efficient?** | No — weak/negative sorting, near-random matching |
| **Who gets retained?** | High-skill captains stay; high-capability agents have turnover |
| **Do good agents buffer shocks?** | No evidence of resilience advantage |

### Bottom Line

The whaling labor market was characterized by **agent dominance** in value creation, **sticky relationships** (switching is costly), and **inefficient matching**. Captain skill is real and portable, but agents appear to have been the key value-creating asset — acting as the **"venture capitalists of the sea."**

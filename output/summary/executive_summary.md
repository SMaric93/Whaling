# Whaling Empirical Analysis: Executive Summary

## Key Findings

### 1. Variance Decomposition (R1)

- **Labor market components** (captain + agent) variance is large relative to outcome variance
- This reflects negative covariance with vessel×period and route×time FEs

**Within captain+agent variance** (KSS-corrected):
  - **Captain skill (α)**: 11.6%
  - **Agent capability (γ)**: 94.1%
  - **Sorting (2×Cov)**: -5.6%
- Model R² = 0.960
- Corr(α, γ) = -0.085 (negative = substitutes)

### 2. Portability Validation (R2)

- OOS prediction coefficient b = 0.149
- Spearman rank correlation = 0.039

### 3. Resilience Under Adversity (R6)

- Interaction coefficient φ = 0.0000
- No evidence of resilience advantage

### 4. Labor Market Sorting (R13)

- Sorting coefficient = 0.1047
- Raw correlation(α̂, γ̂) = -0.0536
- Diagonal share = 18.4% (random = 20%)

## Sample Information

- Analysis sample: 9,229 voyages
